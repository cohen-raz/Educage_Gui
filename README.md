# Educage_Gui
The "Educage_Gui" is a Python based GUI For Comprehensive Data Analysis & Visualization.  
This software designed and implemented for efficient, yet accurate 'on the fly' data analysis.  
The following libraries were in extensive use in the implementeation: numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, PySimpleGUI.

The "Educage" allows efficient training of several mice simultaneously.  
Here, we used the system to train mice to discriminate among pure tones or complex sounds.  
For more inforamtion about the reaserch check the original paper: [Neural Correlates of Learning Pure Tones or Natural Sounds in the Auditory Cortex  (https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00082/full)
  
The Educage_Gui main functionality:
